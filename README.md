# C++ Programming Projects

Hi! I'm a sophomore student majoring in Applied Mathematics, and this repository contains some of my C++ programming projects. These projects demonstrate my growing understanding of programming concepts and my ability to apply them to solve different types of problems.

## Projects

### [Pointers and References](pointers-and-references/)
This project helped me understand one of the most important concepts in C++ programming - how pointers and references work. I created a program that demonstrates different ways to pass variables to functions and how memory is managed in C++. This was a great learning experience that helped me grasp fundamental programming concepts.

### [Transport Dispatch System](transport-dispatch/)
This was a more complex project where I built a transportation dispatch system. It helped me practice working with larger codebases and implementing real-world logic. The system manages transportation requests and dispatches, showing my ability to work with multiple files and organize code effectively.

### [Dungeon Crawler Game](player/)
One of my favorite projects! I created a text-based dungeon crawler game that demonstrates my understanding of game logic, user input handling, and program flow control. This project was particularly fun to work on and helped me learn about creating interactive programs.

### [C++ Tutorials](tutorial/)
This directory contains various small programs I created while learning C++. These include examples of basic programming concepts, value vs reference passing, and pointer operations. These tutorials were instrumental in building my understanding of C++ fundamentals.

## About Me
I'm a sophomore student, majoring in Applied Mathematics,  passionate about problem-solving. These projects represent my journey in learning C++ and developing my programming skills. I'm particularly interested in research opportunities that would allow me to apply these skills to real-world problems.
